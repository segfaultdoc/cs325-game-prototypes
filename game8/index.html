<h2>Multi Tasker</h2>
<h3> Use the right and left arrows. To use the pumpkin then hold down the '3' key at the
top of the keyboard along with the arrows, hold the 2 and while use the arrows for the wooden
bucket, hold the 1 and the arrows for the other bucket. Also the if no numbers are held while
using the arrows, then it defaults to the pumpkin. Use the space bar to stop all buckets from
moving. Clicking the mouse pointer in the game screen resets the game.</h3>

<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about my game is
the characters involved in this 
cyber race.</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
For this game I decided to use some
more advance javascript object oriented
programming. I have modularized my source
files by using an Enemy object and blob object.
Originally I attempted to use ES6 syntax in order
to facilitate inheritance, but this was proving
to be far too complex with github pages.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
The physics can get very confusing. However
I have really learned how useful phaser can
be for making fun games.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Not much out there.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Demonstrates basic physics of moving. Also gravity
and moving right to left using arrow keys.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Buckets trying to catch jobs
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Let's eat the jellyfish, but not the rotten ones!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Prototyping the different keyboard inputs, with gravity.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Just a fun experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Try to catch all the chickens, the game lasts for a minute!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Have fun!
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Cyber space
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone with any hint of randomness!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
One minute!
