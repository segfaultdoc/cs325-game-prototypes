<h2>Random Fun</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about my game is
the irony of a pirate bird collecting
Krabby Patty sandwiches in the ocean.</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
As the class further progresses I would
like to showcase my javascript skills.
I will most reevaluate my efforts going
forward</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
The physics can get very confusing. When things
seem to be working they can break in the blink
of an eye. For example I'm supposed to have
12 krabby patties on the screen and I've done
everything right, but it's not working.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Not much out there.

Demonstrates basic physics of jumping and collisions. Also graviy
and moving right to left using arrow keys.

Pirate Bird, trying to eat krabby patties.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Let's eat the sandwiches, but not the rotten ones!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Prototyping the different keyboard inputs, with gravity.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Just a fun experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Try to catch all the sandwiches, but not the rotten ones!
</li>
