<h2>Random Fun</h2>
<h3> Use up and down keys, the spacebar is the brakes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about my game is
the irony of an airplane collecting
jelly fish sandwiches in the ocean.</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
For this game I decided to use some
more advance javascript object oriented
programming. I have modularized my source
files by using an Enemy object and blob object.
Originally I attempted to use ES6 syntax in order
to facilitate inheritance, but this was proving
to be far too complex with github pages.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
The physics can get very confusing. When things
seem to be working they can break in the blink
of an eye. For example I'm supposed to have
12 jelly fish on the screen and I've done
everything right, but it's not working.
Mainly I've got a better understanding
of the phaser libraries.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Not much out there.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Demonstrates basic physics of jumping and collisions. Also graviy
and moving right to left using arrow keys.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Airplane, trying to kill jellyfish.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Let's eat the jellyfish, but not the rotten ones!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Prototyping the different keyboard inputs, with gravity.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Just a fun experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Try to catch all the sandwiches, but not the rotten ones!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Have fun!
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
An ocean far far away!.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone with any hint of randomness!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
0-Infinity time!
</li>
