<h2>Random Fun</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about my game is
the process behind its innovation.
Love, Laughter, and Randomness are
some of the key ingredients for this
game!</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
As the class further progresses I would
like to showcase my javascript skills.
I will most definitely use reactjs to
beautify the UI.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
Nothing struck out as too hard or easy about
this introductory assignment. I'm sure this
will change as the course progresses.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Main Character <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/football-ball-football-ball-egg-152827/">Football</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Not much out there.

Demonstrates basic physics of a football.
</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
